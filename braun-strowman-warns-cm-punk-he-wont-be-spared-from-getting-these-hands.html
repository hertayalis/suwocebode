While speaking to <a href=#>India Today</a>, Braun Strowman was asked about CM Punk’s alleged “quarrels” with Rollins and McIntyre. Strowman stated that he had no idea about that but made it clear that Punk won’t be spared from ‘getting these hands.’</p><p>“I’ve never met the guy personally, so I don’t know what his quarrels are with Seth Rollins, Drew McIntyre. I’ll make an assessment of what kind of person he is when I get to meet him, but just know he can get these hands like anybody else.”&nbsp;</p><p>Braun Strowman also has a <a href=#>huge opponent in mind for his WWE return</a>. We will have to wait and see if Strowman and CM Punk will ever have a feud in the future, as it might be an interesting choice.</p><p>What do you think of what Braun Strowman had to say about CM Punk?
