Existing tiles, painted or unpainted drywall, plaster, and textured walls are all acceptable substrates for tiling. However, tiling over tile may add a significant amount of thickness to a wall, so be sure your wall is capable of supporting the additional weight. Wallpaper, glossy surfaces, lead paint, and plywood are all examples of surfaces that should not be tiled over.

現在の時点で登録者数５万人と好調な彼ですが、その背景にはぴろん君が重たい病気を抱えて、余命宣告を受けていることに同情した方からの支持が強いあるということです。
余命宣告を受けながらも攻めた動画をアップロードし続けている彼を応援したという思いがあるのです。
しかし、ながら、先日、コレコレがアップした配信動画の中で、そもそも病気や余命宣告を受けていることが嘘なのではないか？という疑惑が出たのです。
もし本当に嘘だったとしたら、長く応援していた方からすると「騙された」と怒りを覚えることでしょう。
ぴろん君のプロフィール。出身地・職業・年収
名前 ぴろんくん 出身地 大阪 職業 元ナンバーワンホスト。スカウト。株式投資。 年齢 ２１歳 趣味 YouTubeの撮影 ぴろん君はYouTubeで活動を始めて日が浅いため、私生活の情報はあまり知られていません。
まだ２０歳そこそこと若いですが、社会経験は積まれてる感じですし、頭も良さそうです。
トーク力があるのは元ホストという恩恵でしょうか？
ホスト時代にナンバーワンを獲得した際には丸坊主だったそうで、見た目はかなり変化してるみたいです。
ちなみにホスト時代にお酒の飲み過ぎで肝臓をボロボロにしてしまい、その頃に余命宣告を受けたとされてます。
年収に関してはホスト時代よりも少ないかもしれませんが、株をやっているということで、株を売って収入を得てることでしょう。
また、スカウトのバッグも何割かもらっていると思います。
YouTubeで稼いだお金自体はまだまだ少ないと思われます。
ぴろんくんの余命宣告。原因はホスト時代のお酒で肝臓がボロボロ・・病名は？ 余命宣告を受けている印象が先行してしまうぴろん君ですが、動画の中での彼をみてる限り、とても健康そうです。
ちなみに病名は「慢性腎不全」だそうです。
具体的な余命は「余命2年、2021年夏までの体」とのこと。
俺は余命が二年で…🎉🎉
でもあと一年半、2021年の夏まではYouTube活動を続けて、ぶっ飛ばしたいなって思ってます。
逆に死ぬってなったら自分のためじゃなく、人のためになる生き方をしたいなって思うようになってしまいました…🙇‍♂️
助けて欲しい人、募集してます。

なので、そろそろ亡くなるということになります。
ぴろん君の余命宣告は嘘？再生数稼ぎの炎上？2021年の夏に亡くなる・・・？ コレコレの動画の中でも語られてますが、ぴろん君の余命宣告はオーバートークだった模様です。
ぴろん君の動画を見て、病院に問い合わせした方がいたらしく、すぐに白状し、謝罪の動画を出してみたいです。
その後にぴろん君がツイッターを非公開にしたということで、
「逃げた」
「最低」
「嘘つけめ」
とプチ炎上してるのです。
まだまだ駆け出しで名前が売れてない時点での嘘でよかったですね。
これで大物ユーチューバーになっていたら、大変なことになっていました。

Teal and a shade of yellow are the best accent colours for each other when it comes to decorating with teal. Therefore, a rug in this hue would serve as a good anchor for the room.
