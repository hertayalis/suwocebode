The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fortnite House</a> is the newest internet collective, featuring just a few of the best <a href=#>Fortnite</a> streamers in the game right now.</p><p>The Fortnite House is part of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NRG Esports</a> group. Most of the members have their own followings in games like Apex Legends, Rocket League, Call of Duty, and others in addition to Fortnite. Their impressive roster of players has made them a huge competitor in the esports game.</p><p>It's no secret that NRG has quickly picked up many of the best Fortnite players out there right now. To consolidate that talent, the group has now put their best players in one house, forming the gaming collective. NRG Esports just introduced viewers to their Season 1 players, with some membership changes when Season 2 begins next month. NRG is already talking about expanding the house's members based on their success this season.</p><p>Here's everything you need to know about the current Fortnite House members.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Clix</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>15-year-old Cody, who goes by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Clix</a> online, is a professional Fortnite gamer, and one of the Fortnite House's first members. He currently has 2.1 million followers on Twitch, where almost every day he streams Fortnite. Clix is a five-time Fortnite World Cup qualifier and revealed on his profile he previously won $162,000 from the tournament.</p><p>Clix is professionally signed with NRG and lives full-time in Connecticut, though he's temporarily living in the Fortnite house with the other members.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Stable Ronaldo</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Ronaldo, who goes by Ron, is another member of the NRG Esports group. With more than 560,000 followers on Twitch, Fortnite is Ron's primary game of choice. While Ron may not have the stats that some of his other NRG Esports members have, he's arguably one of the best players in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>But he's not just known for his Fortnite skills. In fact, Ron's streams are best identified by their horrible microphone quality, which has become a running joke among his viewers.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Unknown</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Best caption in the comments goes on my storyü§£ü§£</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Dominick Green</a> (@nrg_unknown) on Jul 11, 2020 at 2:24pm PDT</p></figure><p>Dominick "Unknown" Green was another Fortnite player quickly snatched up by NRG Esports. Unknown first signed with an esports group in 2019 when he was signed with Team Kungarna, though he was snatched up by NRG less than a year later in February 2020.</p><p>Since he started playing on NRG's team, his following has only grown. Right now Unknown has more than 800,000 followers on Twitch, where he streams almost daily.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Edgeyy</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Despite only having 75,000 Twitch followers, Ben "Edgeyy" Peterson is still one of the best Fortnite players out there, which is why he's signed with NRG Esports. He joined the esports group back in September 2019, and has been with them ever since. Prior to signing with NRG, he played for FlyQuest.</p><p>Edgeyy is a multi-time trio winner, and while he didn't qualify for the Fortnite World Cup, but he's already making waves on the Fortnite Reddit boards as a player to watch for.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm7yzwM2iq55lmKTCtLGMppymmpWnwA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hulk-hogan-still-regrets-wearing-cowboy-boots-during-infamous-wcw-heel-turn.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Hulk Hogan Still Regrets Wearing Cowboy Boots During Infamous WCW Heel Turn</span></a>
