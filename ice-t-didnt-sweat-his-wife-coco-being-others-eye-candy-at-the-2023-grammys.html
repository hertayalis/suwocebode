While you never know how one's partner will react to people checking out their significant other, Ice-T couldn't help but find it hilarious, per <a href=#>Page Six</a>. The rapper was so unfazed that he actually shared a video of the situation on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p>In the video, you can see Ice-T and Austin dancing to a music performance. As the two stars enjoy the show, another man appears to look at Ice-T and before checking out Coco. At the time, the "Law and Order: Special Victims Unit" star didn't seem to notice the man looking at his wife, but now the whole world knows with his post. Ice-T captioned the video, "Lol... I love how the white dude looked at me then took time to check Coco out.... I TOTALLY understand.. #2023Grammys" Clearly, the rapper is used to his wife getting attention and doesn't blame people for taking time to admire her.</p><p>Just like Ice-T, many of his followers found the video hilarious. Rapper Busta Rhymes <a href=#>commented</a> on the post with a bunch of laughing emojis. Another user <a href=#>remarked</a> on Ice-T's "confidence" for playing it cool. Meanwhile, others preemptively <a href=#>apologized</a>&nbsp;for staring at Coco in case they happen to cross paths someday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlpZoNyfI6imp5lpGKxqrDNrWSsr5WWwW60yKxksKGWmnqku8KoZJudmaO0brvToZyrq12axqZ5wpqlnbFdlsFuwMeeZGtoYmh6qL7ApqSyq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./intels-11th-gen-core-rocket-lake-detailed-ice-lake-core-with-xe-graphics.html><span>←</span><span>Ice Lake Core with Xe Graphics</span></a>
