With time, Joy has come to be charmed not only by the scenery and weather but the people of San Diego as well! And in return, she shares with us her vision of how she sees people: in a bold and romantic manner!</p><p>Often, she gets up close and intimate, filling the frame with her subjects in a way that lets the rest of the world fade into irrelevance. Other times Joy makes expert use of her environment to include storytelling elements for an elopement. Framing with leaves and capturing couples walking into the misty mountains are just a few ways Joy creates art that evokes romance.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>8. <a href=#>Jessica Beamon</a></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The deserts and oceanside of SoCal just might be the perfect place for a romantic elopement photoshoot. Small wonder Jessica Beamon does so much of her best work there. Her outdoor elopements perfectly mesh the allure of the West Coast with couples’ stories of escaping from the wider world.</p><p>Jessica’s photography ranges from celebratory to more intimate in character, depending on the mood of the environment and her couples. And in all cases, we get to see aspects of each couple that highlights their uniqueness in the face of tradition, including fun clothing choices and tattoos.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>9. Aaron of <a href=#>San Diego Elopements</a></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>If you want a specialty elopement photographer, Aaron and his team at San Diego Elopements is a great place to start. Full of ideas, as his client feedback attests, there’s no elopement too small for them to take on. Bright, vibrant colors are what San Diego Elopements use to tell the story of each couple!</p><p>It’s a match made in heaven when you add it to the abundant California sunshine they shoot under. The blues of the groom’s clothes coupled with an expansive sky are a perfect match for the whites of the bridge—little details that they intentionally use to add zest to the tale!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbHEq6qpmZOae6S7zGipnqufqr%2BksdJonKWnoJq6prrTZqehp6SktLOtz6Gcq6tdqK6vecOinKCnXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./st-john-nordstrom-spring-sale.html><span>←</span><span>The 15 Best Chunky Loafers of 2024 to Wear All Year</span></a>
