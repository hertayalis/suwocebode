Despite this fact, these adornments are much respected and adored by fans throughout the globe. On that note, here is a list that includes all of Jungkook’s body piercings throughout the years.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ear-piercings data-injectable=false>Ear piercings</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1389408711.jpg><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>During BTS’ debut in 2013, Jungkook displayed only one earlobe piercing in each ear. The then-15-year-old exhibited an affection for piercings — alongside his BTS peers — all of whom (for the exception of J-Hope) have had piercings since the group’s beginning.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true>About a year after, in 2014, the youngest member seemed to have plugs until the “Dope” era. Not particularly wide, the plugs were about five mm wide, thus avoiding any enlargement of the earlobe during that time.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>In the course of 3 years and throughout the Wings and Youth eras, Jungkook showcased several other piercings. Now counting three earlobe piercings, as well as two helix piercings, the lead dancer has taken on the role of the bad boy of BTS. Both helix piercings had closed by the time the Love Yourself era came about and haven’t yet made a comeback, much to the fans’ discontentment.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=661 data-injectable=true>During the pandemic, Jungkook seemed to have focused most of his body alterations on his sleeve tattoo, but never neglected piercings. From 2021 until now Jungkook wears a total of 6 lower ear piercings in his right ear and around 3 or 4 lobe piercings in his right ear.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false><strong>Facial piercings</strong></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>when jungkook put his fake piercing on taehyung’s nose and tae turned to him then jungkook said “it suits you alot”…what if taehyung nose piercing next sksksks <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/5Fblr1RQf2</a></p>— 제이 (@dionyverrsss) <a href=#>October 2, 2021</a></figure><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=752 data-injectable=true>It wasn’t until 2021 that Jungkook displayed his boldest piercing modification till then: an eyebrow piercing. During the “Butter” promotion events, the vocalist appeared to have an eyebrow piercing, creating many speculations on whether it was just a sticker. These speculations proved to be true when, in May 2021, Jungkook took off his eyebrow sticker and even glued it on BTS’ V’s face on the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Butter Livestream in the Vlive app.</a>&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>After some time Jungkook admitted to actually piercing his eyebrow during his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vlive solo Livestream in his studio</a>. Earlier this year, however, Jungkook took out his eyebrow piercing, causing the fans to mourn the much-adored adornment.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=711 data-injectable=true>Not long after, in October 2021, the “Dynamite” singer also caused quite an uproar online, appearing with a lip piercing during the group’s appearance on The Fact Music Awards. During the “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Boy With Luv</a>” performance, the BTS vocalist showed to have a side labret lip piercing, only a stud at the time. Facing the biggest challenge to South Korea’s norms by the group, Jungkook’s piercing has now taken the form of a lip ring on the 24-year-old’s face.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>JUNGKOOK'S LIP PIERCING, IT'S REAL OH MY GOD <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/CDglJeck0G</a></p>— jk vids 🎥 (@jjklve_) <a href=#>October 2, 2021</a></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Speculation Piercings</h3><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true>Since showing his bolder facial piercing collection, there has been a number of speculation on which other piercings the Grammy-nominee might have</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Tongue Piercing</h4><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>During Muster 2021, a two-day festival in which BTS and ARMY celebrate the group’s anniversary, Jungkook appeared to have a shiny speck on the inside of his mouth, resulting in many fans arguing whether it was a piercing or just saliva. Shortly after, the singer yet again seemed to have a piercing on his tongue during a Livestream to celebrate his birthday.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=661 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>So jungkook saw us hyping over his tongue piercing on muster & NOW he got one???😭<a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8c5vpkZGIG</a></p>— 🖇Nowshin⁷|🥛🍥🍓 (@BestBoy_Koo) <a href=#>September 1, 2021</a></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Nipple Piercing</h4><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>JUNGKOOK NIPPLE PIERCING??? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YhtHSP9uCW</a></p>— Len♡.jimin misser.

Many fans have since questioned if the youngest member has gotten a nipple piercing or not. Yet, during the 2022 Permission To Dance: On Stage concerts in Las Vegas, Jungkook wore a rather revealing outfit during the group’s “Fake Love” performance at times showing his chest, which did not seem to have any piercings on it.</p><p data-characters=151 data-current-count=151 data-injectable=false>In total, the vocalist of BTS has 10 piercings on his body, most of them being concentrated on his ears, and recently expanding to his facial features.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>In spite of all the speculations and uproars caused by the youngest BTS member, if there is one thing that can be expected from Jungkook’s body modifications, ARMY will always support the main singer and lead dancer of BTS.</p><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=false>If you’re a member of the BTS ARMY or are just curious about their music, you can check out their new album, Proof, which is set to be released on June 10th, and available for pre-ordering right now on most platforms.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46ao6Vln5t6q8HNoKKop5uoeqO7w7JkqaGVp7CqusasZK2npJa5brzInqmcoZ6ceqS71KeraA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-truth-about-ross-mathews-weight-loss.html><span>←</span><span>The Truth About Ross Mathews' Weight Loss</span></a>
