Day?</b></h2><p><span>One of the most common New Year </span><span>superstitions</span><span> is that no loads of </span><a href=#><span>laundry</span></a><span> should be done on January 1.</span></p><p><span>Yet some go one step further and follow a tradition that any dirty clothes should remain untouched from </span><span>Christmas</span><span> all the way up until New Year’s Day.</span></p><p><span>According to an ancient myth, washing your clothing on these days could lead to "washing a loved one away" and could also bring about bad fortune, as doing laundry or the dishes around the New Year will wash away all your good luck.</span></p><p><span>Similar to laundry, people are urged not to do any sweeping, wiping or </span><span>cleaning</span><span> on New Year's Day, as it could cause a loved to be "swept away" or you could</span><span> sweep away any upcoming good fortune.</span></p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most Read in Lifestyle</h2></p><p><span>Even emptying </span><a href=#><span>the bins</span></a><span> should be avoided on New Year's Day.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Some superstitions say that removing anything from the house on the first day of the year could cause your prosperity to disappear.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In other cultures, it is also believed that whatever a person does on the first day of the year will be reflective of the next twelve months.</span></p><p><span>So, in this case, it means doing chores, such as laundry, will essentially bring with it a year of hard work.</span></p><h2><b>Where did the superstition originate?</b></h2><p><span>It is unknown where or when the tradition of avoiding housework on New Year's Day originated.</span></p><p><span>However, that hasn't stopped people from following it for years.</span></p><p><span>It is believed that this particular superstition is particularly observed in southern </span><a href=#><span>US</span></a><span> states.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Getty-Clothes-line-4.jpg><h2><b>What other superstitions do we associate with New Year’s Eve and Day?</b></h2><p><span>On top of the strict laundry rule, some believe that you should not have empty pockets on New Year’s Eve, since it may be a sign of very low or no income in the year to come.</span></p><p><span>Another popular legend that people follow is the infamous kiss at midnight.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>According to some, this is not just as a mark of affection, but in order to ensure our feelings remain for the other person over the next twelve months.</span></p><p><span>It is also believed that at the stroke of midnight, you should make as much noise as possible in order to scare the devil off from approaching.</span></p><p><span>Many cultures also think that if you step into the New Year leading with your right foot, you will start it out, well, on the right foot.</span></p><p><span>Other superstitions include hitting bread on your doors and walls to fend off evil spirits and bad luck, and taking a stroll with an empty suitcase to bring good fortune to </span><span>travel</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, crying on the first day of the new year is thought to set the tone for the next 12 months, and eating 12 grapes at midnight is supposed to bring good luck for every month of the new year.</span></p><p><span>Also on the list of superstitions surrounding New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day are:</span></p><ul><li><span>Opening your front door before midnight to allow the old year to exit and the new year to enter</span></li><li><span>Stuffing your wallet with some cash represents a bank account bursting with </span><span>money</span></li><li>Taking seven laps around your home to help you lose any negative energy you may have been harbouring</li><li><span>Eating black-eyed peas and collard greens on New Year's Day will supposedly bring good luck and prosperity</span></li></ul><p class=postsid
