However, their hopes were shattered when the police made the heartbreaking announcement that Barrie’s lifeless body had been recovered from the Hudson River, following the earlier discovery of Garrett Warren’s body in the Harlem River.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-alfa-barrie-cause-of-death-what-killed-him><strong>Alfa Barrie Cause Of Death: What Killed Him?</strong></h2><p>Officials recently revealed that Alfa Barrie’s body, along with 13-year-old Garrett Warren, who were both reported missing for over a week, was found in different rivers. Sadly, Warren’s cause of death was determined to be accidental drowning. However, the exact cause of Barrie’s death is still unknown and will be determined after an autopsy, which is scheduled for Monday. The results of the autopsy are expected to provide more insights into the circumstances surrounding Barrie’s untimely passing. We will provide further information once the autopsy results are available.</p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunCty5%2BYZpqRp7%2BqsYycmK6rlWK8p3nDnpitoF2Wu6V5zpugra2Rp8Zw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./raven-elyses-boyfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Raven Elyse Dating Raven Elyse's Boyfriend &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
