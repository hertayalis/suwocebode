Any amount of wandering around can give evidence to that. Sometimes you can stumble across rare things out of nowhere, but generally, if you want to find something, there are hot and cold zones for just about anything. So if you need bugs or rocks to improve your relationship with a Palian out there (or perhaps a robot who really likes fishing) then it’s best to collect everything you can at first.</p><p>If you’re just starting out, the world may seem a little big to sift through. Once you get your bearings and collect everything in sight, try to study the map and determine where different areas are. Just make sure you unlock the Belt and Smoke Bombs first so that you aren’t hunting without the right tools.</p><p data-injection=true><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Palia How to Complete Lost in the Wind</a></p><p>The dire need for a Lunar Fairy Moth is easily fixed. It’s an Uncommon bug, but that doesn’t make it especially rare. If you want to find a Lunar Fairy Moth, try looking in any of the following locations:</p><ul data-injection=true><li>Both north and south of Proudhorn Pass</li><li>Hideaway Bluffs</li><li>Pulsewater Plains</li><li>Outskirts</li></ul><h2>What are Lunar Fairy Moths Used for?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/palia-common-butterfly-caught-1.jpg><p>Lunar Fairy Moths are good for selling, charming potential lovers, or just having them on display. If you sell one, you don’t get much gold for it, only 34. But if you manage to bag a 5-star quality Lunar Fairy Moth, you can turn it around for 54 Gold. While it isn’t especially valuable, catching a good few and selling them in bulk isn’t a bad idea for some quick cash.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4873925f808875d90d25f0a0702e0598?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Jessica Oliver</h3><p class=author-url><a href=#>http://Gamepur.com</a></p><p class=author-desc>Jessica Oliver is a passionate writer, editor, and story enjoyer.
