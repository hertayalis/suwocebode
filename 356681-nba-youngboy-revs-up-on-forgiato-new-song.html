While there&nbsp;are melancholic moments where YB describes struggles with mental health and addiction, he offers a fiery banger with "Forgiato." Riding smooth Southern production handled by Dubba-AA, Mike Laury, and The Lottery, NBA Youngboy comes through swinging with aggression and defiance in the face of pressure, whether it's in the streets or the&nbsp;media.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">YB's latest album has been doing numbers on streaming services but it seems entirely possible that it could be able to end <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a>'s three-week reign atop the Billboard 200 with&nbsp;Certified Lover Boy.

Throughout his time, Aron’s helped introduce a number of buzzing up-and-coming artists to our audience, identifying regional trends and highlighting hip-hop from across the globe.
