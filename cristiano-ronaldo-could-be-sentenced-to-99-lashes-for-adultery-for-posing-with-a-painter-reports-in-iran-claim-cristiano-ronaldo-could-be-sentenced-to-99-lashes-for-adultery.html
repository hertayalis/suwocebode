Ronaldo kissed her on the cheek, gave her a signed shirt, and posed for a photo hugging her, which has caused controversy among Iranian lawyers.</p><p>Under Iranian law, physical contact with a married woman is considered equivalent to adultery.</p><p>Hamimi, reportedly ’85 per cent paralyzed’, is a devoted fan of the footballer. Iranian network Sharq Emroz, as per Mundo Deportivo, claims that the Iranian justice system swiftly reacted to the photo by sentencing Ronaldo to 99 lashes upon his next visit to Iran.</p><p>Al-Nassr is currently participating in the Asian Champions League group stage, and if they progress to the knockout rounds, Ronaldo could potentially be required to return to Iran.</p><p>If he does return, it is speculated that he may face arrest by Iranian authorities to serve the sentence. However, according to Marca, the sentence could be pardoned by a judge if the actions are not deemed punishable or if Ronaldo expresses remorse.</p><p>Ronaldo has been in a relationship with Rodriguez since 2016, and they have two children together. Rodriguez also mothers his other three children.</p><p>Rodriguez and the children relocated to Saudi Arabia with Ronaldo after he joined Al-Nassr, in a deal confirmed on New Year’s Eve last year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiaq6Gjqbaius5mqaimkaGxsHnCqKylnF2Xsm6%2FxKernqaTmrFuwM5mcHJlnJbAqbHSZp2oql2Wsba4056psmWWpL9uvM6soKefXay2tbSMmmSpmZmjwaa%2BjKucqaeiqcButc1moKuZnmKwra3IpmScqpmowaqtzahkq6eelrmlu4ycpq6klGKvpnnSnqWtnZ6YsqV506hkcnFdoa60tMSsZJ%2BnomKupcHLrZyrsV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fady-chamoun-obituary-death-cause-family.html><span>←</span><span>Canfield Football Member: Fady Chamoun Obituary Death Cause And Family</span></a>
