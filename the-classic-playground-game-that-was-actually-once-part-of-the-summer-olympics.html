Tug of war continued to spread and increase in popularity in places like 12th-century India. As the years went by, it continued to be a popular pastime.</p><p dir=ltr>In 1896, the first modern <a href=#>Olympic Games</a> were held, reviving the ancient Greek tradition, 1,500 years after the games had been banned by Roman Emperor Theodosius I (per <a href=#>History</a>).&nbsp;The first modern games were fittingly hosted in Athens, Greece, and just 13 countries participated. However, tug of war was nowhere to be found on the schedule for the 1896 Games and didn't make its Olympic debut until four years later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCFj2lqaW5fqbWmecKlmKyrmZh6sbjAsp6rp6WjsW6zwKacZqyYlsFuw8CsZJqbpKqurbjYZqanm5VivaK%2B02amn2WknbJuv9SmpJ6qXaS5urnPopqsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./simon-ginty-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Simon Ginty Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
