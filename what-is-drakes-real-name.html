Dennis was responsible for giving Aubrey his middle name Drake. "His reasoning behind it, I am not sure," the rapper told <a href=#>HipHopCanada</a> about his dad's choice of Drake. "My dad is a character so it could be anything," Drake explained. As a teen, Drake landed a role on the Canadian TV series "Degrassi: The Next Generation" and was credited by his birth name Aubrey Graham. At this time, he also started to develop his skills as a musician. When it came to choosing a stage name, Graham decided to stick with his middle one. "I just really loved the name and I embraced it my whole life," he revealed. "I like the fact that I have two names because I find that in this industry you have to have dual personalities [especially] being a transitional entertainer," Drake added. According to this dual threat, he considered his Drake persona to be closer to his true personality while Aubrey Graham was a more polished version of himself.</p><p>Even after he became a superstar, Drake never shied away from his acting history or how he, in his own words, started from the bottom as Aubrey and worked his way to the top. "This is my real age, my real name, my real past, and I'm good with that," Drake told <a href=#>GQ</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamloZoZ2go6wn5qsXZ7AbrDRmqKeq12nsqK4jKeYpp1f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./noah-hathaway-bio-wife-parents-net-worth-where-is-he-now.html><span>←</span><span>Noah Hathaway Biography, Wife, Parents, Net worth, Where is he now?</span></a>
