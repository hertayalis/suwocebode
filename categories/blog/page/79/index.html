Seemingly such was the case for Gigi when she hit the red carpet at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival for a screening of the film Firebrand (Le Jeu De La Reine) on Sunday in a custom Zac Posen fishtail gown that took its inspiration from a vintage design that Bella already once wore.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Hilarie Burton</h2><time>Jun 8, 2024</time>
