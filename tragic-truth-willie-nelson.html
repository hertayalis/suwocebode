Among the assets the government agency seized were the singer's Texas home and most of the possessions inside it.

His sister Lana reveals his struggle with depression, per the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>. "It's not that we had long talks about our grief&nbsp;— that's not Willie's way," Bobbie shares.
