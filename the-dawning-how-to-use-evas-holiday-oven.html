Anyone who wishes to partake in this event will need to make their way to the Tower and speak with Eva, who is eagerly awaiting to see your return and teach you about using the Holiday Oven 2.1.</p><p data-injection=true>You will need to do this for every part of the activity when you start. The way you go about using the Holdiay Oven can be a little tricky, but it’s a simple way to do it, and if it might be a bit confusing. Here’s what you need to know about how to use Eva’s Holiday Oven during The Dawning in Destiny 2.</p><h2>How to use Eva’s Holiday Oven</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Destiny-2-Evas-Holiday-oven.jpg><p data-injection=true><strong>After you visit Eva in the tower, she will give you her holiday oven</strong> <strong>and it will be in your quest menu</strong>. When you’re ready to use this item, open up your inventory, go to the Quests tab and then look at the details of the oven.</p><p>This goes into the oven menu, allowing you to make delightful treats for Guardians and other characters in the game. The first of the top two boxes is your recipe slot, and you hover over this to bring up a full list of all the recipes. As long as you have the ingredients for a recipe, you can click on it here to make it automatically using each ingredient you need. <strong>Each treat needs two ingredients and some Essence of Dawning</strong>. Check out our guide about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">where to find all the ingredients</a> to ensure you can track down every recipe for everyone you need to make them for in Destiny 2.</p><p data-injection=true>The bottom boxes are your individual ingredients. This was more important in previous years when the game did not automatically tell you the various recipes. We have a useful guide that will <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">show you all the recipes</a> in the game, so be sure to check it out. That’s it, Guardian. The oven is not difficult to use; it can just seem a little strange initially because they don’t give you much information in the game. With our helpful guides, you will be cooking up all kinds of treats in no time.</p><p>The Dawning 2023 event is exactly similar to the previous year, making it perfect for anyone in Destiny 2 who might have missed it last year or who may not have been able to finish everything they wanted to complete. Make sure you speak with Eva to activate your Event Card and start earning your rewards before the event ends.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/17c418c90324bdc0fbd0bc2ce42fdf32?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Zack Palm</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Zack Palm is the Senior Writer of Gamepur and has spent over five years covering video games, and earned a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Oregon State University.
