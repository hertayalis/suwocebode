I'm willing to align myself to get close to, so that I can understand. Just like I didn't understand Spanish, but I got close to it and learned to speak it. French. Japanese. Musical instruments.

"What Malik paid me to do, as a 13 and 16 year old, wasnt love," Mariah wrote. "His ignoring that I was clearly a child prostitute, wasn’t love. Paying for cheap thrills and secret orgasms; begging for unsafe, unprotected sex from a runaway Trans teen, while enjoying stardom as a successful artist and business man ....isn’t love."
