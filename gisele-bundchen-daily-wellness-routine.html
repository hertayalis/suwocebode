There’s a different ritual when I’m with them and when I’m not,” she said. “When my kids are with me, they have so many activities. It’s difficult to manage my schedule and their schedule.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Regardless, she continued, “[t]he most important thing for me every day is to put the oxygen mask on me first.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To ensure she’s taking care of her mental and physical self, Bündchen said, she likes to “go to bed at about 10:00 p.m.” and wake up to meditate “around 5:00 a.m.” every day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also likes to drink “lukewarm water with a little lemon and Celtic salt” to start off her mornings, and soon after takes a moment to stretch, and then walks and feeds her German Shepherd. As for what she eats in a day, the Brazilian model and cookbook author said she maintains a natural, nutritious vegetable- and fruit-heavy diet (eggs, avocado, smoothies with almond paste for protein), and never eats white sugar, which she considers poison. “There’s so many other ways you can sweeten your things that are delicious,” she noted. “Honey, maple syrup, dates.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also works out six days a week. “I love Pilates, because I had back surgery three years ago and it helps with your core. I like exercise outside: surfing, swimming, horseback riding, volleyball. When I’m on holiday, I do more of that. I do weights about two days a week, cardio about two days a week,” she said, adding that she also goes on lots of walks for her mental health.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When asked how she remains so positive, Bündchen said simply: “To live in a state of gratitude is like a protection in your life.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We can look at things like, why is this happening to me? I believe we are here because we all have something to learn and to evolve and to grow,” she added. “When I look back, the biggest, most challenging experiences in my life were all happening for me. They showed me that I was stronger than I thought I was.”</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/49ca5303-a74f-4d73-a0f8-6a94e1338358_1714666618.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" title="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Rosa Sanchez is the senior news editor at Harper's Bazaar, working on news as it relates to entertainment, fashion, and culture.
