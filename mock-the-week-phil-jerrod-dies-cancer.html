He has been told that he will not be able to work for three months after the op. &nbsp;Now, as self-employed comedians, we know that we don't have such luxuries as sick pay etc.</p><p>"And cancelling an Edinburgh run and 3 months worth of work is a big ol' deal. &nbsp;I really don't want Phil and Beck (his lovely wife) to be worrying about making ends meet while they should be concentrating on Phil getting back to full fitness.
