Then again, neither did Roman Reigns, Randy Orton, or Rey Mysterio. But Bliss’ absence has caused some to get worried about a possible injured suffered the previous night in Hartford.<br>Dave Meltzer explained on<a href=#> Wrestling Observer Radio</a> that he hadn’t heard for sure that Bliss was injured by Ronda Rousey during the house show, but&nbsp;only time will tell if the rumors we’ve been hearing are true.</p><p>“Alexa Biss was replaced by Tamina. It was supposed to be Ronda Rousey and Nia Jax against Alexa Bliss and Mickie James. I don’t know. I had heard stuff about Alexa being injured — that would have been at the Hartford show. I had asked people at the show and they didn’t see anything. So I don’t know if that’s the case. Hopefully, I’ll know more tomorrow as well.”</p><p>There are some fans who are saying that Ronda Rousey injured Bliss during their tag match in Hartford as Rousey teamed with Nia Jax vs Alexa and Mickie James. A broken nose is also rumored but seems very specific when nothing has been confirmed yet.<br>These are just rumors until we get some kind of confirmation. Bliss is, of course, scheduled to be at Raw tonight which is the go-home for WWE Evolution and she’s involved in a pretty big match on the show. So it looks like we should be getting our&nbsp;answer soon enough as to if she’s okay or not.<br><br><br></p><span class=author-name>H Jenkins</span> <span></span><p>I love pro wrestling and hate BS.
