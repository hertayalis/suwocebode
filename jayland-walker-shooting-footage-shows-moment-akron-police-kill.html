I trust that investigation to be fair, thorough, and just.”</p><p>"By formally requesting that BCI handle this initial investigation, we are following what I believe to be best practice and which many communities across the country are now doing," said Mylett.</p><p>"Utilizing an independent entity to conduct the investigation will be a further step in increasing trust and accountability with our citizens.”</p><p>Deputy Mayor Marco Sommerville said that releasing the footage is a change that the community "has been requesting for decades."</p><p>"From here, we need to be patient and allow that investigation to run its course. I'm urging peace for our city throughout this process."</p><h2>AKRON POLICE AND MAYOR RESPOND TO SHOOTING</h2><p>Horrigan and Mylett released a joint statement on June 29 in response to the shooting.</p><p>“We know that no police officer ever wants to discharge their service weapon in the line of duty. And anytime they must, it's a dark day for our city, for the families of those involved, as well as for the officers," the statement begins.</p><p>"Tragically, we are once again faced with a young man, with his life before him, gone too soon. Every single life is precious, and the loss of any life is absolutely devastating to our entire community.</p><p>"Our prayers are with Jayland Walker’s loved ones, and we offer our sincere condolences to all those who knew him. Our thoughts are also with our Akron police officers and their families.</p><p>The statement continues, reassuring citizens that the body cam footage would be released in the coming days.</p><p>"We are keeping our promise to the community, understanding that there can be no trust without transparency and follow-through on commitment.</p><p>"We have every confidence in the Attorney General's Bureau of Criminal Investigation to conduct a thorough, fair, and honest investigation. We will cooperate fully with that investigation and have made it a top priority for our staffs.</p><p>"As a city, we are committed to this process and trust that it will yield a fuller understanding of this incident.”</p><p>At the July 3 press conference, Horrigan added: “I fully support our residents right to peacefully assemble, but I hope the community can agree that violence and destruction are not the answer.”</p><h2>THE AKRON COMMUNITY RESPONDS</h2><p>Shortly after the footage was released, hundreds of members of the Akron community took to the streets.</p><p>Protestors gathered to condemn the actions of the police department and officers involved.</p><p>The demonstration was organized by the NAACP chapter in Akron.</p><p>Many were carrying signs reading "Justice for Jayland" and were heard chanting: "No more dying."</p><p>The Walker family has also released statements through their lawyers.</p><p>“They want to turn him into a masked monster with a gun,” Bobby DiCello, lead attorney for the family told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Daily Beast</a>.</p><p>DiCello's colleague, Ken Abbarno agreed, saying, “The officers will need to account for every single action that they did."</p><p>“We live in a society where we can never see this happen again.”</p><p>“The Walker family is praying for peace, they are asking for peace, they are praying for accountability,” Abbarno said following Sunday's press conference.</p><p>“We cannot villainize Jayland.”</p><h2>AKRON CANCELS JULY FOURTH CELEBRATIONS</h2><p>Also in response to the shooting, the city of Akron has canceled its Rib, White, & Blue Festival.</p><p>The festival was supposed to be held from July 1-4.</p><p>In a statement released by the city, residents were encouraged to find other plans and opportunities to celebrate the holiday weekend.</p><p>“I completely understand that some residents and guests will be disappointed by the decision to cancel the festival this holiday weekend," Horrigan said in a statement.</p><p>"Independence Day is meant to be a celebration and a time of gathering with friends and family.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More On The Sun">Read More On The Sun</h2><p>"Unfortunately, I feel strongly that this is not the time for a city-led celebration.”</p><p>The city also said that all vendors and musical acts scheduled to appear at the festival will be compensated.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zZ6urGdla4Z1hZVrZqOZqaGur7CMsJilo5WnerS0zqiroqaXYrOwu9Oanp5lo528uL%2BMpqamnZ6peqK30ailZqifobaksYykoKWkXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gregg-hughes-net-worth-148647.html><span>←</span><span>Gregg Hughes Net Worth</span></a>
