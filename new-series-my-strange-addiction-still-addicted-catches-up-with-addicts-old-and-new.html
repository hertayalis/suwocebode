Each episode followed two “addicts” of engaging in a bizarre behavior – typically compulsive in nature and with the person unwilling to change their ways, even in the face of potential danger.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=360 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>Many of the show’s addicts consumed non-food items on a daily basis – including detergent, glass, and their own furniture. Objectophilia was a common theme on the show – perhaps most famously Nathaniel, a man claiming to be dating his car, named “Chase.” Plastic surgery addicts and people who openly display fetishes were also prevalent.</p><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=629 data-injectable=true>My Strange Addiction was a ratings hit during its original run from 2010-2015, and clips of the series from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TLC YouTube</a> channel have racked up hundreds of millions of views. Given its unceasing success, it is no surprise that the network has comissioned a revival.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/TLC-Tweet.png><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=755 data-injectable=true>In the trailer for new series <strong>My Strange Addiction: Still Addicted?</strong>, viewers are introduced to some familiar faces from the original series. The returning cast includes Nathaniel, now in a polyamorous relationship with mutliple vehicles. He now claims to have a “family” with his lover, Chase. There are plenty of new faces, too – including health addicts trying dangerous holistic health trends, such as drinking urine and eating raw meat.</p><p data-characters=530 data-current-count=530 data-injectable=true>The original My Strange Addiction was met with much criticism for its depiction of behavioral disorders and mental illnesses, having a “freakshow” approach to showcasing bizarre behaviors to viewers rather than handling such cases with care. The series has also been accused of being “fake” – fabricating storylines for the show. This is often the sentiment in cases where the addict seems to be engaging in deadly behavior on a daily basis for years at a time, seemingly without impacting their health.</p><p data-characters=152 data-current-count=152 data-injectable=false>The new series could address these criticisms or take a new angle, but viewers will find out July 19th, when the first episode airs on the TLC network.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yvsdZmqp6qmZrAbrnYZqqtqpGjtKZ5wJ2bopuknryvedKtoKWkXZaxpbXCrZydZZOWwaS0xKxkrqhdrLa1tIyam52hk6nAbrvLnWSappRiu6bDjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-does-janina-gavankar-html.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Money Does Janina Gavankar Make?
