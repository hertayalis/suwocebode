The princess-style ballgown is the total opposite of her character's famous gothcore style. Featuring a a tea-length skirt, the dress was covered in lavender, green, and gray floral embellishments and visible boning.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ortega accessorized with Dior jewelry that included a diamond necklace, bracelet, and matching staple ring. Her glam matched her ethereal frock, including shimmery lilac eyeshadow and a subtle mauve lip. She wore her signature deep brown hair in a waved lob with curtain bangs.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The hit show is nominated for 12 total awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series. The show has already taken home the trophy for four of the categories prior to tonight's ceremony: Outstanding Original Main Title Theme Music, Outstanding Contemporary Makeup (Non-Prosthetic), Outstanding Contemporary Costumes for a Series, and Outstanding Production Design For A Narrative Contemporary Program (One Hour Or More),</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is Ortega's first Emmy nomination. However, she received a nod for the role at the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>2023 Golden Globes</a>, where she arrived in a head-turning beige Gucci gown with bold cutouts, dramatic flowy sleeves, and a pleated ruffled skirt and train. Her hair was coiffed into a flipped-out wolf cut with face-framing curtain bangs.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ortega stars in the show, which has been renewed for a season 2, alongside the original Wednesday Addams Christina Ricci. And while Ortega immensely looks up to Ricci, she previously said it was "intimidating" to work with her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’ve never been so awkward. I felt like I didn’t know what to say to her,” she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Variety</a> at the premiere. “I think she’s a fantastic character actress. I know her as Wednesday in my head, so it was intimidating. But she’s so wonderful and talented — she made it really easy.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-more-in-celeb-news></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>More in Celeb News</span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yZ6lp5ldpL%2B1scaaZJ6lna7AbrDIqKlmnpykv6K4jJuYpaSXpMSveZdtaW5tYm0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bitboy-crypto.html><span>←</span><span>BitBoy Crypto</span></a>
