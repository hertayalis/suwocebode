The incident led to time spent in isolation, as well as a "2C" inmate classification. This is the most restriction an inmate at Clark County Jail can receive, TMZ reports.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">When returning to Nevada court this week, the alleged criminal had guards on each side of him, covers on his hands, and a mesh face mask. Even with the past tension between them, Holthus kept her composure during sentencing. She agreed with prosecutors in giving Redden a 19-48 month sentence for the battery incident. Today (January 9), he's speaking with a different judge in regard to his latest crimes, for which he's facing 13 charges.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-judge-mary-kay-holthus-sentences-her-attacker-in-las-vegas>Judge Mary Kay Holthus Sentences Her Attacker in Las Vegas</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">According to FOX 5 Vegas, Redden has a long list of felony counts against him. Attempted murder against an older person, battery on a protected person resulting in substantial bodily harm against an older person, and extortion are all named. Elsewhere, prosecutors say the inmate is guilty of unlawful act regarding fluid by a prisoner in confinement, and battery by a probationer or parolee. "In the next few days, my office will be reviewing all of the reports to determine what charges to bring based on Mr. Redden’s behaviour in court," Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson told the outlet. "We’re reviewing all the reports, the witness statements, the extent of the injuries suffered by persons, certainly felony charges without a doubt."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The past few months have been particularly busy in the crime world, with the YSL RICO trial, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>YNW Melly</a>'s impending double murder retrial, and Jonathan Majors' <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">guilty verdict</a> among topics making headlines. Unfortunately for the Florida native, his day in court has been postponed, meaning he'll be spending even more time awaiting his fate in a cell.
