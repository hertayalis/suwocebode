In the video, Lee shows off a text thread between him and the "Grease" star, the latter of whom inquired, "Tommy can you send me that peanut butter Chico [sic] chip cookie recipe you have." Lee complied.</p><p dir=ltr>Travolta was thankful for the recipe (and was met with a swift "You're welcies!!!!!!!" from Lee) and went on to make his own batch. At the end of the video, Travolta was seen asking, "Who would've thought that two superstars would spend their Wednesday nights making brownies and cookies?" Lee chimed in at the end in a separate clip, noting that he and <a href=#>wife Brittany Furlan</a> were also wondering the same thing. Well, we wouldn't have guessed it, but we sure as heck want some of those cookies!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb21jZYV0e9OhnGarpKeur7PEZpqopp6asLW1zqdkraedosZuuMSeZKGZo2LBsHnJqJ%2BnZaSnrre7y62YZqqVq7KiuMSdZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./southside-johnny-rock-stars-net-worth-273833.html><span>←</span><span>Southside Johnny Net Worth</span></a>
