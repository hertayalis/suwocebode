He eventually landed with her ex, happily, but that didn't happen immediately. Indeed, in true Raquel fashion, there was some serious dog drama involved. Here's what went down.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Why did Raquel give up Graham in the first place?</h2><p>In July 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> first reported that the fuzzy puppy was dropped off at a shelter.</p><p>He was reportedly experiencing behavioral problems, including biting. From there, the <a href=#>Vanderpump</a> Dog Foundation got involved, and happily, the golden, curly canine got to go home to James.</p><p>James only found out that the dog was no longer living with his ex thanks to a mutual friend. He has Graham in training and the dog is no longer a danger to those around him.</p><p>And, as if to rub salt in a wound, we are now being treated to a slew of photos of Graham via James's Instagram.</p><p>Adding insult to injury, James has been sure to include photos of his girlfriend, <a href=#>Ally Lewber</a>, cuddling with the fuzzy rehabilitated hound.</p><p>Meanwhile, fans have some thoughts about the whole Graham situation.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by James Kennedy (@itsjameskennedy)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Fans are upset and happy that Raquel gave up Graham.</h2><p>Vanderpump Rules viewers are invested in the Graham drama, which culminated in a reunion on film between the pooch and his dog dad.</p><p>As one demanded, "Why in the hell did Rachel not give James the dog!? She put it through all that trauma when she knew James desperately missed him. Poor Graham. So glad he’s back with James."</p><p>Even <a href=#>Kristin Chenoweth</a> weighed in, commenting on James's Instagram, "I’m so glad you have him back. I just saw how it all happened. I’m furious with what’s her name. But thrilled you have him back!!"</p><p>Many fans admitted to crying upon seeing Graham, whose <a href=#>name is seemingly being changed to Hippie</a>, trot down the stairs at James's home.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Talk about suicidal we don't know what Raquel is going through it has to be really bad and no one doesn't know my God if she was unable to take him Graham I can imagine where she is in her life right now mentally I hope someone can reach out to her <a href=#>https://t.co/Qdw8MWbZNi</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Nwd84HyeH9</a></p>— Johnny K. Ward (@Ward1Johnny) <a href=#>February 21, 2024</a></figure><p>Meanwhile, as many fans vented their anger about Raquel not contacting James about her issues with Graham, and resorting to dropping him at a shelter, some expressed concern over her mental state if she resorted to letting go of her beloved pet.</p><p>Indeed, the reality star has had no shortage of low points in her life of late. She has been a social outcast ever since the <a href=#>affair with Tom Sandoval</a> came to light.</p><p>As Raquel admitted in a New Year's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>, "2023 hands down has been the hardest year yet. My life had become completely unmanageable and I was so far down the rabbit hole of making bad decisions that I NEEDED help."</p><p>She went on to allude to things getting better, and looking ahead to the future with hope. We're glad that Graham is safe and in a home where he's loved.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aqkabCpriMoJytZaKesW67xWaeq5mYlrpuwsCnm56qoKq6sXnRrqOeqw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ncis-los-angeles-ll-cool-j-sam-hanna-is-he-leaving.html><span>←</span><span>Where is Sam Hanna on NCIS: Los Angeles?
