The 12-member panel also chose not to convict Rudolph on lesser offenses, including second-degree murder and manslaughter.</p><p>Rudolph was first&nbsp;<a href=#>arrested</a>&nbsp;in April 2021 after four men went to his home several hours after he fought with his girlfriend, investigators said. At some point, Rudolph armed himself with a semi-automatic rifle and opened fire on them as they drove away, killing Sebastien Jean-Jacques and wounding Tyler Robinson.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w><p>Rudolph testified that the men were armed and shooting back at him. Investigators said they never found evidence of the fleeing men returning fire.</p><p>Rudolph was Florida State’s leading receiver in 2015 and 2016. He left the team early to enter the NFL draft in 2017. He eventually signed with the New York Giants and then the Miami Dolphins. He also spent time with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League. The team released him after his arrest.</p><p class=endmark>He gained national attention in 2016 when a video of him eating lunch with an autistic student during a team visit at a Tallahassee middle school went viral. Rudolph’s father died a year later after a gun accidentally discharged at a West Palm Beach strip club.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r67Cp5ywq16YvK57zZ6urGelqHqvsdasZp6wXZu5sL7InZhmq6SWwaZ5xaimrZqRobluwNGaraKrXafCpbvLqZ9mpp%2BpeqjByKWrsmWdqr%2BlsdFmqZymkW2Fc4KT</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christian-biscardi-bio-career-net-worth-height-and-relationship.html><span>←</span><span>Christian Biscardi : Bio, Career, Net Worth, Height, And Relationship</span></a>
