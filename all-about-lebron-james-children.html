Both Bronny and Bryce were born before the couple's wedding in 2013, and Zhuri arrived a little over a year after the big day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's clear from their social media accounts that both Bronny and Bryce have plans to follow in their father's footsteps on the basketball court. In February 2022, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>LeBron told The Athletic</a> that he plans to spend his final year in the NBA on the court with his oldest son. He said, "My last year will be played with my son. Wherever Bronny is at, that's where I'll be."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">LeBron echoed those sentiments in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>2022 Sports Illustrated feature</a>, saying, "I put it in the air because I like to talk to the basketball gods out there and see if things can come to fruition. I've always set out goals in my career, talked to the basketball gods, and they've listened to all of them. Hopefully, they can listen to this last one, too." Bronny and Bryce also joined their father on the issue's cover with the tagline "Chosen Sons." (LeBron's iconic Sports Illustrated cover in 2002 famously proclaimed him as "The Chosen One.")</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The NBA great has shared how much he loves his kids, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>telling Access Hollywood in 2021</a>, "My daughter is the greatest thing in my life, along with my boys. So, whenever she smiles, it don't matter what I'm doing, it makes me happy." Although he has been open about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>the emotional toll</a> of being away from his wife and kids when he is on the road for the NBA, telling USA Today, "I miss the hell out of my family. My wife, my kids, my mother. And so on and so on. It's a huge challenge."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In February 2023, LeBron's wife and children were sitting courtside when he became the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>NBA's all-time leading scorer</a>. The James family then rushed to celebrate with him on the court at Crypto.com Arena. Ahead of the milestone, Bronny, Bryce and Zhuri recorded <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>congratulatory video messages</a> for their dad.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Congratulations, dad. Proud of all the work you've done. I love you so much," Bronny said. And Bryce added: "Congratulations, dad surpassing Kareem for all-time scoring. I'm so proud of you. I love you. Keep it up."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kevin Mazur/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the 2023 ESPYs in July, LeBron received the award for best record-breaking performance after surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s NBA scoring record. Before presenting him with the award, Savannah, who was joined by the couple's three children on stage, said a few words about her husband — and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Zhuri helped her keep it TV-friendly</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Savannah started to say, "LeBron James is the baddest mother—,” only to be cut off by Zhuri, who said, "Mom!" The little girl shook her head, urging Savannah not to swear in front of the audience.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The mom-of-three started over and said: "I think LeBron James is the baddest to ever set foot on a basketball court. Nobody works harder. Nobody cares more and nobody has done more for the game of basketball.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead, read everything to know about LeBron and Savannah James' three children.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-lebron-bronny-james-jr-19></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>LeBron "Bronny" James Jr.</strong>, 19</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Cassy Athena/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">LeBron and Savannah's first son, LeBron "Bronny" James Jr., was born on Oct. 6, 2004. Bronny began playing basketball as a child and could play in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>NBA as early as the 2024-2025 season</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bronny has had a lot of success of his own. In 2019, he led his high school, Sierra Canyon School, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>to a win against his dad's alma mater</a>, St. Vincent-St. Mary High School, in a spirited game played in LeBron's hometown of Akron, Ohio. In July 2021, he made it to the cover of Sports Illustrated at the age of 16 — six months younger than <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>his dad was for his own cover in 2002</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">LeBron has admitted that he plans to do "whatever it takes" to spend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>his last year of professional basketball</a> playing with his oldest son. In February 2022, he told The Athletic, "My last year will be played with my son. Wherever Bronny is at, that's where I'll be. I would do whatever it takes to play with my son for one year. It's not about the money at that point."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A few days after turning 18 in October 2022, Bronny signed an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>endorsement deal</a> with Nike, which LeBron celebrated on Instagram by sharing a side-by-side photo and video of him and his son on the basketball court. The proud dad, who has been a Nike athlete since the start of his pro career, wrote in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Instagram caption</a>, "The Legacy Continues On!! Congrats Young King!!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Jan. 11, 2023, Bronny's mom, dad, and siblings supported the young athlete at his high school <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>senior night game</a>, with his little brother Bryce playing as well. After the game, the whole family posed for photos on the court.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later that month, Bronny was chosen as one of 24 high schoolers for the 46th annual <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>McDonald's All American Game</a>. Playing in the prestigious game is a huge honor, but especially so for Bronny as it allows him to follow in his father's footsteps, who made the team in 2003.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">LeBron celebrated his son's accomplishment by posting a screenshot of the roster <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>on Instagram</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Ayyyyyyyeeeeee @bronny!!!!!!

You're truly AMAZING!!!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Soon after, Bronny kicked off his college basketball career by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>committing to the University of Southern California (USC)</a>. The young athlete announced his decision in a May 2023 Instagram post, in which he shared a photo of himself in the Trojans' locker room.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Fight On ✌🏾 #committed," he wrote in the caption.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In July 2023, Bronny <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>suffered from cardiac arrest</a> during a workout at USC. A representative for the James family released a statement the next day, explaining, "Medical staff was able to treat Bronny and take him to the hospital. He is now in stable condition and no longer in ICU."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later that week, LeBron&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>posted an update</a> on Bronny's health.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Everyone doing great," he&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wrote on Twitter</a>.

The following month, a spokesperson for the James family said they were "very confident in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Bronny’s full recovery</a>."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bryce-maximus-james-16></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Bryce Maximus James, 16</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Andrew D.

At the time of Bryce's birth, LeBron and the Cleveland Cavaliers were trying to make a comeback against the San Antonio Spurs. A <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>representative for LeBron and Savannah told PEOPLE</a>, "LeBron and Savannah are overjoyed with the birth of their son and are looking forward to bringing him home to his big brother, LeBron Jr."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">LeBron celebrated Bryce's 10th birthday in a big way in 2017 when he shared a video on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a> of himself singing "Happy Birthday" to his son. He captioned the video, "Happy Bday Bryce Maximus!! Can't believe you're 10 years old man. Time is serious flying.

Just like his father and older brother before him, Bryce plays basketball, sometimes sharing photos from his school games on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>his Instagram account</a>. In August 2022, he received his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>first Division I scholarship offer from Duquesne University</a> in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to play basketball.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-zhuri-nova-james-9></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Zhuri Nova James</strong>, 9</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Lebron James Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A year after LeBron and Savannah got married, they welcomed their third child, daughter <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Zhuri Nova James</a>, on Oct. 22, 2014.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The little girl already has an eye for fashion. When she was just 5 years old, Zhuri helped launch Janie and Jack x Harlem's Fashion Row clothing collection in 2020. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Zhuri told PEOPLE about hosting the event</a>, "I'm most excited about the fashion and talking to the designers." She also noted that she "practiced with" her mom ahead of the big day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">LeBron loves to give Zhuri big gifts, and in October 2020 he showed off the new playhouse he bought ahead of her birthday, which was modeled off their family home. He <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>shared a video on Instagram</a>, captioning it, "Early bday gift my princess!!!!!
