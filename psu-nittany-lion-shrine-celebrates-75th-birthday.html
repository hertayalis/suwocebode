The Penn State community is happy to celebrate.</p><p>The shrine was a gift from the class of 1940. The lion was officially dedicated as a part of Penn State’s homecoming festivities. The iconic nittany lion was built from a 13-ton block of limestone.</p><p>The shrine has suffered some accidental damage and has been vandalized by rival fans on several occasions -- but the lion still stands. Ever since 1966, ROTC students' guard the shrine as a part of homecoming traditions.</p><p>In May of 2013, a new stairway, path and lighting were added. Today, people stopped by and explained why the shrine is important to them.</p><p>"It's very significant on so many levels, it's our mascot in sports but a place to come and become a part of the whole Penn State culture," said assistant professor Dr. Alexis Santos.</p><p>"So many Penn Staters come and visit with their families. You have births that are celebrated here, weddings, graduations,” said Penn State alumni Matt Haas. “So it's a great way to have Penn State remember through not only so many pictures on campus but the shrine as well."</p><p>Haas came to visit from Chicago and made sure his family stopped by to take pictures with the lion shrine today. The lion has some damage on the ear but through it all, the Nittany Lion shrine has survived and lasted as one of Penn State’s most iconic landmarks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmpawtcKNnKamZ56axLR7y6iamqRfpcC2ec2iq62Znq56rbXOp2SsoKKeu6Z5wp6jnpqilsGmv4xwbK2gXZe2s8DHnZiy</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./olga-bicherova.html><span>←</span><span>Olga Bicherova</span></a>
