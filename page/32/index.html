<a href=../../microsoft-officially-unveils-the-surface-pro-with-lte.html></a>
Earlier this year, Microsoft announced the next generation of their popular Surface Pro, and at the launch event, a new LTE model was also announced, but without a release date. That release date is now a bit more firm, with the company announcing that Surface Pro with LTE Advanced will be available to business customers beginning in December 2017.
The new model will feature a Cat 9 modem, which would be capable of up to 450 Mbps, and it will support 20 cellular bands for ‚Äúglobal connectivity‚Äù over LTE.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Motherhood is Hard, But We're Judged if We Say We Don't Love It</h2><time>Aug 3, 2024</time>

Have you been overwhelmed, clueless, and tired all at the same time? Have you lost your temper, felt so guilty you cried, forgotten to wash your hair today?
