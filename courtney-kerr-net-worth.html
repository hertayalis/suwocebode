Her career started in the early 2000s.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Courtney Kerr is, as of early 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Kerr’s net worth is as high as $200,000, an amount earned through her career in the entertainment and fashion industries.</p><h3>Courtney Kerr Net Worth $200,000</h3><p>A Texas native, Courtney has always been a stereotype southern girl, only with more focus on fashion and success in television, than in music. She struck-up a friendship with Amber Venz, stylist and jewelry artist, with whom she started a business venture, making them both relatively successful, and establishing Kerr’s net worth at least. Also, Courtney serves as the manager of one of the Sunglass Hut retailer’s outlets, while she is a frequent guest of fashion shows held in Dallas.</p><p>Thanks to her presence in the fashion industry, Courtney became quite well known all around Dallas, which only opened her doors to success. Back in 2011 she featured in the TV reality show “Most Eligible Dallas”, and Courtney brought attention to herself through her fun, vibrant and unique personality. Consequently she soon enough got her own show, entitled “Courtney Loves Dallas” (2013), which further increased her wealth, and popularity as well. Also in 2013 she featured in yet another reality show “Millionaire Matchmaker”, which as with many such shows was hardly realistic, but provided some talking points.</p><p>To speak further of her business ventures, Courtney launched a blog, called “What Courtney Wore”, which also contributes to her net worth.</p><p>Regarding her personal life, there isn’t very much valuable info about the Texan diva, which isn’t already known; however, she has apparently been in a romantic relationship since 2014, but unfortunately the name of her boyfriend is unknown in the media. Previously she was associated with Matt on “Most Eligible Dallas”, and Stefan on “Millionaire Matchmaker”, but neither seemed a very serious involvement. Her mother is in process of recuperating from cancer, while Courtney’s father left the family.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Bethenny</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself - Guest</td></tr><tr><td>Courtney Loves Dallas</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself</td></tr></table><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjpymrqqko7K6ecqeqatlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./movie.html><span>←</span><span>Car Wash (1976) - Michael Schultz | Synopsis, Characteristics, Moods, Themes and Related</span></a>
