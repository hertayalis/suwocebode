That year, she also appeared in Tyler Perry's The Family That Preys before taking a role in 2009's I Can Do Bad All By Myself. She also appeared in the 2010 remake of The Karate Kid, which was a commercial success despite poor reviews.</p><p class=wp-caption-text id=caption-attachment-298355>Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images</p><p>Next, Henson played the central role in Taken From Me: The Tiffany Rubin Story, earning an Emmy Award for her performance.

His father was Henson's high school sweetheart, but he was murdered in 2003. In 2014, her son was detained by police officers, who found marijuana and Ritalin without a prescription in his car. After initially complaining that her son had been racially profiled, Henson backtracked on her statements and apologized to the police.</p><p>Taraji P.
