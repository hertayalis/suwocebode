Gordon and his wife, Tana Ramsay, typically used their U.K. house as a vacation home for the holidays. Since COVID-19, however, he’s spent more time at the immaculate residence, which is big enough for their five kids: Megan, Holly, Jack, Matilda and Oscar."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The Kitchen Nightmares star prefers to spend his time at his estate in Cornwall, though, especially since he was quarantining there amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Gordon and his wife, <a href=#><strong>Tana Ramsay</strong></a>, typically used their U.K. house as a vacation home for the holidays. Since COVID-19, however, he’s spent more time at the immaculate residence, which is big enough for their <a href=#>five kids: Megan, Holly, Jack, Matilda</a> and <a href=#>Oscar</a>. Located on the beach on the north Cornwall coast, the <a href=#>Food Network</a> star and Tana’s property features a main house with two kitchens, five bedrooms and four en-suite bathrooms.</p><p>The duo also has a second building on their plot of land, which comes with three bedrooms, a dining area and a living room. The longtime lovebirds — who wed in 1996 — purchased the residence for more than $5 million in 2015, per the <a href=#>Sun</a>. They later invested more than $2 million in renovations, adding a boathouse, wine cellar and infinity swimming pool, according to <a href=#>Cornwall Live</a>.</p><p>In addition to the sprawling living area, Gordon and Tana’s pad comes with a deserted beach and a dreamy view of the countryside. If the <a href=#>Emmy</a> nominee or his spouse want to go for a run, they happily can since the beachside property boasts so much outdoor space.</p><p>As a long-running TV star and restaurateur, it’s no surprise Gordon’s favorite room in his house is the main kitchen. The doting dad is always whipping up the best meals for Tana and their kiddos, so he made sure to deck out the space with top-of-the-line appliances.</p><p>The MasterChef star has given many glimpses inside his kitchen while cooking via Instagram, including the time he uploaded a video of Oscar fooling around in one of the cabinets. “Getting to know his spices,” he wrote in the caption. From countless storage spaces to a wall-mounted oven and microwave, Gordon’s home has everything he needs to continue perfecting his skill.</p><p>In addition to their beautiful Cornwall pad, Gordon and Tana are the owners of multiple other homes, including one in London and another in Los Angeles. For Gordon, spending more time at home during the COVID-19 pandemic gave him the inspiration to create a new cookbook,&nbsp;<i>Ramsay in 10</i>. The book is full of recipes that can be executed in just a few minutes, an art he has mastered in the beautiful kitchen of his Cornwall estate.</p><p>“No passports. No flights. No schedule,” he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-linkindex=2>The Orange County Register</a>&nbsp;in October 2021. “You’re not filming. You’re staying home and you’re cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner. If you told me that two years ago, I’d never have believed you. We had to get super creative and go quick and easy and uncomplicated.”</p><p><strong>Scroll below to see pictures inside the pair’s Cornwall residence!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn56qlWKxsLHSZp6oqpSku26%2BwKaqmrFdoba3sYypn6isn6h6qrrSopueZZiewG6vzqulsJmcoXqpu8yeZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-avril-lavigne.html><span>←</span><span>What happened to Avril Lavigne?</span></a>
