What’s the update on Chill Soda? The Shark Tank brand was billed as a “healthy soda revolution,” offering carbonated beverages with less sugar and fewer calories than the usual vending-machine offerings.
In Shark Tank’s first season, Chill Soda found a big fan in investor Barbara Corcoran. “I love having a soda I can actually feel good about giving to my kids, and best of all, my kids loving drinking it,” she says in a quote on the Chill Soda website."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Mackey came on the ABC reality show seeking an investment of $50,000 for 10 percent equity in his company. He told the sharks that Chill Soda is organic and low-glycemic and features anti-oxidants but no high-fructose. “But the best thing? It tastes like regular soda,” he added. “It is good.”</p><p>Better yet, the sharks seem to like the taste of the Chill Soda samples Mackey handed out.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>But then Mackey didn’t know the answer when Shark Tank star <a href=#>Kevin O’Leary</a> asked him what the “ultimate leverage of success for all players in the beverage industry” is.
