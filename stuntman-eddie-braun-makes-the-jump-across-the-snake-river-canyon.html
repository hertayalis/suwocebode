Stuntman Eddie Braun just mimicked the legendary jump across the Snake River Canyon that his role model, Evel Knievel, attempted 42 years ago. Braun took off at 3:54 p.m. from a property a few miles up the river from the original spot. He launched off a 10-story ramp, flying about 2,000 feet in the air at a speed of 400 mph. This jump mirrored Knievel's in almost every way, including the technology."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

He launched off a 10-story ramp, flying about 2,000 feet in the air at a speed of 400 mph.</p><p>This jump mirrored Knievel's in almost every way, including the technology.<br></p><p>He's been preparing for the past three years and spent about $1.6 million of his own money on the jump. That includes the work of engineer Scott Truax, who is the son of Robert Truax, the engineer who built Knievel's rocket back in 1974.<br></p><p>"Before I could even think I was doing the five-count," Truax said. "I said see you on the other side. Five, four, three, two...one, he didn't hesitate a second, boom! He was gone."</p><p>He says it was a moment of redemption for him and his father. If his father was here today, he would be proud to know that his rocket actually worked.</p><p>"No question!" Truax said. "Done it! Proved it! So like I said, Evel didn't pull the chute and didn't chicken out and my dad's rocket would've worked, so we cured history 42 years later."<br></p><p>Truax spent the last eight years working on this launch, and he wasn't the only one looking forward to it.</p><p>People from all over the country made the trip to watch.</p><p>"They announced when they were gonna jump it," said Mark Weinhandl, a Las Vegas resident. "Booked the hotel. Booked the car rental. Told my boss I wasn't gonna be at work. And I jumped in the car and drove out here."</p><p>Braun deployed a parachute after the jump. No word yet on his condition post-jump.</p><p>Knievel has been Braun's idol and inspiration since the day they met in the 1970s.</p><p>Braun says he is attempting the jump not to prove he can, but to fulfill the dream of his hero.<br></p><p>Watch his jump here:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihlJa1sLrEsKpnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxmpaeTlrlwv9Oupa2lkaN6prDDopxmmqKWwq95zJqinqtdqbWmecmupKllkZi%2FsL%2FSZquhnV2ou6K3xGapoq6Vp3qkrc2ypqc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lemon-crinkle-cookies.html><span>←</span><span>Lemon Crinkle Cookies Modern Honey</span></a>
