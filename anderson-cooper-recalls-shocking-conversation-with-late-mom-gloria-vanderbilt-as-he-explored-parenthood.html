However, this particular conversation had taken a completely unexpected turn.</p><p id=e70hdi87k5K data-wc=40>Anderson remembered: "She told me, 'Honey, there's something I really need to talk to you about.'" He playfully added that while he had braced himself for one of her typical whimsical tales, he wasn't quite prepared for what came next.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2eb059fb2b83-anderson-cooper-gloria-vanderbilt.jpg><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Related</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Anderson Cooper's family was once worth $200 billion, but what is his net worth today?" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/402dca0f8997-gettyimages-1490501094.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Anderson Cooper's family was once worth $200 billion, but what is his net worth today?" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Anderson Cooper's family was once worth $200 billion, but what is his net worth today?</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e0W89_0ULRm data-wc=23>"She began by saying, 'I went to the gynecologist the other day,' and keep in mind, my mom was 85 then," Anderson shared.&nbsp;</p><p id=eCmNW_oCWmD data-wc=48>"She continued, 'And she told me the most astonishing thing, that I could still bear children.'" The news took him aback. At 56, Anderson highlighted how he's honed the skill of maintaining a composed face, largely thanks to a lifetime of responding to his mother's more outlandish declarations.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/092928fe8cac-anderson-cooper-family.jpg><p id=eHUxrih9R3a data-wc=21>"I've spent years not reacting to my mom's unique statements," he said, playfully. "So, I just responded, 'That's truly remarkable, Mom.'"</p><p id=eoft2wOA00W data-wc=40>His initial assumption was that Gloria was considering having another child of her own. In jest, Anderson said, "My immediate thought was, 'How can I dissuade my 85-year-old mom from having a baby?' I'm sure we've all been there, right?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ef4dc1778bda-anderson-cooper-children-7.jpg><p id=exTKa3G9R5X data-wc=53>Gloria then dropped the real bombshell. Rather than having a child for herself, she offered to be a surrogate for Anderson. "I had to tell her, 'Mom, I deeply love you, but this is a bit over the top, even for you,'" Anderson recollected, amused by the audacity and depth of her proposition.</p><p id=e__5ztmjcVk data-wc=16>In the end, Anderson and his former partner, Benjamin Maisani, did choose the path of surrogacy.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cc49b45be43b-anderson-cooper-children-4.jpg><p id=ecR9yEOftf data-wc=50>Together, they were blessed with two sons—Wyatt in 2020, who's now three, and Sebastian, who's 19 months, born in 2022. Gloria's passing in 2019 meant she did not witness the birth of these two additions to the family, but her legacy of love and eccentricity surely endures in their lives.</p><p id=eoFvlMyNe8Z data-wc=51>Anderson's love for his children is palpable. This year, he celebrated Wyatt's third birthday with a heartwarming Instagram tribute. Posting endearing photos with his sons and alongside Benjamin, he wrote: "Wyatt Morgan Maisani-Cooper turned 3 today! He and his brother Sebastian are the most precious blessings I could've ever wished for."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
