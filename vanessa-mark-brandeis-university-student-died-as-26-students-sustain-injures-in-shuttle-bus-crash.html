Ryan said in a statement that the bus was transporting students to and from a hockey event at nearby Northeastern University. Northeastern is roughly 13 miles from Brandeis.</p><p>No charges have been filed, and the reason of the incident, which happened around 10:45 p.m., is under investigation by her office and the Waltham Police Department.</p><p>University spokesman Julie Jette confirmed Sunday that the deceased student has been identified as Vanessa Mark, a 25-year-old undergraduate from Waltham.</p><p>“Given the tragedy that our community is experiencing, Brandeis has canceled classes scheduled for Monday and Tuesday,” the institution said in a statement. “This will enable some students to return to family and friends sooner than the typical holiday timetable would have allowed. For students who will remain on campus, we will have additional opportunities to gather and receive support.”</p><p>School records indicate that the bus belonged to Joseph’s Transportation of Medford, Massachusetts. Federal records indicate that the corporation owns a fleet of 30 automobiles.</p><p>On Sunday, the business did not immediately respond to calls and emails.</p><p>Thanks for reading from <a href=# rel=noopener>Ghsplash</a> a news publishing website from Ghana.
