For six years the 33-year-old worked for luxury lingerie brand Kiki de Montparnasse before starting her own clothing company, Chapel, in 2016.</p><p>The label was known for its collection of vintage T-shirts and grew popular among celebrities like Rihanna and Kanye West, but shuttered a year-and-a-half after opening. Around that time, Alessandra became pregnant with her and then husband Jon Neidich’s first child.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"At the moment, I’m not currently working but dying to go back to work, although I think it’s not realistic until after our son comes," the socialite told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pregnancy blog Hatch</a>. "I know that as much as I want to be a super hands-on mom and really involved, I also think that it’s extremely important to have something for yourself."</p><p>The pair welcomed son Nash with the help of Alessandra’s mother. "My mom is a midwife and OBGYN so I’ve basically had an on-call, 24-hours-a-day person obligated to answer my every question and concern," she admitted. "Basically, my entire birth plan consists of: 1) Go into labor 2) Call mom."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Alessandra Brawn and Jon Neidich’s wedding was covered by 'Vogue'.</h2><p>The duo tied the knot in October 2014 at a family friend's villa in Tuscany. "Jon and I had our heart set on getting married somewhere far away and romantic," the businesswoman explained to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a>. The ceremony took place in front of 400 guests under a giant stone pine on the property.&nbsp;</p><p>The blonde beauty walked down the aisle in a lace gown by fashion designer Peter Dundas. "I don't consider myself to be an extremely traditional person, but the one thing I really wanted was this traditional wedding dress silhouette with sleeves and a train," Alessandra noted.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Gorgeous!

Later in the evening, the bride changed into an Emilio Pucci minidress.</p><p>Alessandra and Jon, a chief executive at Golden Age Hospitality, separated less than four years later in 2018.

"There’s nothing like [being a dad]," he said. "It’s the greatest thing ever. There is no other single thing in my life that is even in the same category."</p><p>Will added that his boys often visited him on the set of the 2018 family comedy Show Dogs. "They were super psyched when I was making it. Everything about it was just like a home run for them," he shared.
