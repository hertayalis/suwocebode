"The story is old, it's often been told / Of a rich city boy and poor country girl / Their families tried hard to keep them apart / But they became each other's world," Partin sings, per <a href=#>Genius</a>. These words are representative of lovers who, like the characters of Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet," have a rocky road ahead on their journey toward love, as they come from two different worlds.&nbsp;</p><p>"Thank you for letting me share this tale about star-crossed lovers with you," Parton wrote in an <a href=#>Instagram</a> caption about the song.&nbsp;The lyrics of the track end tragically with the words, "They drove faster and faster, as fast as could go / 'Til they crashed in a field of bluebonnets below / They placed a marker saying may you rest in peace / Now their souls soar together in the blue bonnet breeze." This emotional finale shows off how Parton is able to create meaningful, plot-driven music that deeply impacts and touches the hearts of her audience.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcG5lboF6e9OhnGaqlZa5brnEmqWippdir6a0yKebZpyfobm6ec%2Baqa2nnqh6o7jUnmSbp56jsrV5waucnrKVZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tbt-rita-moreno-marlon-brando-relationship.html><span>←</span><span>Rita Moreno and Marlon Brando</span></a>
